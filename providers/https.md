  A provider that Josh can use to communicate with an HTTPS API, on a remove
  server running the josh-api server
---

# HTTPS

This provider is planned and not yet available. The josh-api server is also not yet developed.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The HTTPS provider is an extremely delicate and complex piece of... thing... that will require a significant amount of both security and technical know-how to get working. While I'm competent, I'm not a genius, and as such, it will take me some time to get right.

If you know a lot about JS safe eval, Dockerizing stuff and the `piston` module, I would gladly and graciously accept your help in the project. Please, contact me via Github!
